She is one of the Doctors of the Church, patroness of Italy, mystic, woman of action, heroine against overwhelming odds, persuaded Pope Gregory XI to leave <em>Avignon</em> and return to Rome.</p>\n<p>Catherine Benincasa is the youngest of the 25 children of a prosperous Sienese wool-dyer.  She rejected marriage and religious life but enamored of consecrated virginity.  At sixteen, she became a Dominican tertiary but continued to live at home.  For three years she left her room only for Mass and Confession.  Her mortification reached the point where she would manage on a spoonful of herbs and few hours of sleep a day.</p>\n<p>At nineteen, after the experience of Christ placing a ring on her finger, visible only to herself, she resumed normal family life and began to care for the sick &#x26; the poor.  Soon people were attracted by the charm of Catherine’s human &#x26; supernatural qualities … her gaiety, religious fervor, social involvement, unconventionality, loyalty to the church, etc.  She wrote, “their concern was to remove hatred from people’s heart and bring them to peace with Christ crucified and their neighbors”.  At twenty-eight she received the stigmata, which also remained invisible to others until her death.</p>\n<p>She had become all love for God and neighbor, ecstasies, peace missions, letters to help others and care for the ills of the church.  Infused wisdom and the gift of exhortation were her special charisms.  She took 23 of her group on the three month’s historic embassy to Avignon.  Reforms she saw would come not with war but with peace and quite, with the humble &#x26; continuous prayers.</p>\n<p>She died in Rome at the age of thirty three sealing her activities with this offer of her life:\n<em>“O eternal God, receive the sacrifice of my life for this mystical body of holy Church.  I have nothing to give but what you have given me.  Take my heart, therefore, and press it to the face of this spouse.”</em>   </p>\n<p><em>[<strong>Avignon</strong> is a city in southeastern France where once the seat of the pope during 1309-1377. In some of those years, the Church had even two popes, one in Avignon and one in Rome.  St Catherine was instrumental of having Pope Gregory XI leave Avignon &#x26; ended the confusion and returned the proper papal seat to Rome].</em></p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>\n<p>(Reference:  Lives of the Saints by Fr Augustine Kalberer OSB.)</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Saint Catherine of Siena","date":"April 29, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/st-catherine-siena/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/reconnect/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Reconnect"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/priestly-ministry/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Priestly Ministry and the Essentials of Christian Discipleship in the Time of Coronavirus"}}}}}
