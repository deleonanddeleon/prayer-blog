&lt;h3&gt;Quote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“When we are filled with pride, we distance ourselves from God.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Scripture Passages:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Psalm 138:6&lt;/strong&gt;  Though the Lord is on high, He looks upon the lowly, but the proud He knows from afar.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 23:12&lt;/strong&gt; Whoever exalts himself shall be humbled, but whoever humbles himself shall be exalted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Matthew 5:5&lt;/strong&gt;  Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit the earth [from the Beatitudes - Sermon on the mount].&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 14:11&lt;/strong&gt;  For everyone who exalts himself shall be humbled while he who humbles himself shall be exalted.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Luke 1:52&lt;/strong&gt;  He has deposed the mighty from their thrones and raised the lowly in high places [from Mary’s Canticle].&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Liturgical Year]]></title><description><![CDATA[The Liturgical Year consists of the cycle of Liturgical Seasons in Christian Churches that determines when feast days, including…]]></description><link>http://bibanco.deleonanddeleon.com/liturgical-year/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bibanco.deleonanddeleon.com/liturgical-year/</guid><pubDate>Tue, 02 Jun 2020 02:14:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Liturgical Year&lt;/strong&gt; consists of the cycle of Liturgical Seasons in Christian Churches that determines when feast days, including celebrations of saints, are to be observed and which portion of Scripture are to be read either in an annual cycle or in cycle of several years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Liturgical Cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their own mood, theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colors of paraments and vestments for clergy, scripture readings, themes of preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in home.  Following the decision of the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church revised the lectionary in 1969, adopting a three-year cycle of readings for Sundays (cycles A,B,C) and a two-year cycle for weekdays.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church beginning with:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ADVENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; is the time of preparation for both the celebration of Jesus’ birth, and His expected second coming at the end of time. This season lasts until Christmas eve on Dec 24. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;CHRISTMAS&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; follows with first vespers on the evening of Dec 24 and ending with Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ORDINARY TIME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; comes next.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;LENT&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; follows which is the period of purification and penance that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Then comes the &lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Easter Triduum&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; from Mass of the Lord’s Last Supper in Holy Thursday including Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. The days of the Easter Triduum recall Jesus’ last supper with His disciples, His death on the cross, burial, and resurrection. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;EASTER&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt; then follows with seven-week liturgical season climaxing at Pentecost. This feast recalls the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles/disciples after Jesus’ Ascension.  &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;ORDINARY TIME&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  comes next again, but with more days, and completes the liturgical year. &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Colors of Priests’ vestments:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Green&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  =  used during Ordinary Time&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Purple/Violet&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  =   used during Advent and Lent&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;White and Gold&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  =  most appropriate during Christmas and Easter&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Rose&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  =  on the third Sunday of Advent and fourth Sunday of Lent (this color is a sign of anticipated joy). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;Red&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  =  for feast day of the Passion and for the Holy Spirit; feast day of martyred saints.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;White and Black&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/strong&gt;  =  used during funeral masses.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I received a novena for covid-19 and mentioned the intercession of the &lt;strong&gt;Fourteen Holy Helpers&lt;/strong&gt;.
Who and what are they?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are group of saints venerated by Catholics because of their intercession is believed to be
effective against various diseases.  They are called &lt;em&gt;“Nothelfer”&lt;/em&gt; in German &lt;em&gt;(“helper in need”)&lt;/em&gt;, originated
in the 14th century during the &lt;strong&gt;Black Death&lt;/strong&gt; in 1346-1349 (bubonic plague) where millions died.  Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers is found in Bamberg Germany.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;The 14 Saints are:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Acacius (Agathius)&lt;/strong&gt; - against headaches.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Barbara&lt;/strong&gt; - prayed for fever; against sudden &amp;#x26; violent death.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Blaise&lt;/strong&gt; - prayed for the ills of the throat; protection of domestic animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Christopher&lt;/strong&gt; - invoked against plagues; against danger while travelling.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Cyriacus&lt;/strong&gt; - invoked against temptations on the deathbed; demonic possession; against eye diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Catherine of Alexandria&lt;/strong&gt; - protection for sudden death; diseases against the tongue.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Denis (Dionysius)&lt;/strong&gt; - prayed for the relief of headaches; against demonic possessions.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Erasmus (Elmo)&lt;/strong&gt; - for abdominal maladies; for domestic animals; against fires; patron of sailors.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Eustace (Eustachius)&lt;/strong&gt; - prayed as healer of family troubles; domestic animals.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. George&lt;/strong&gt; - protection for domestic animals attacked by plague; against palsy &amp;#x26; skin diseases.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Giles&lt;/strong&gt; - for good confession; invoke against plagues, epilepsy, mental illness, nightmares.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Margaret of Antioch&lt;/strong&gt; - as patron for safe childbirth; against backaches, kidney diseases; invoke for escape from devils.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Pantaleion&lt;/strong&gt; - patron of physicians and medwives; against TB, lung diseases and cancer.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St. Vitus (Guy)&lt;/strong&gt; - against chorea, epilepsy, nervous diseases, lightning, animal bites (rabid, venom). &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They are part of the Communion of Saints that we can pray to intercede.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Looking Back]]></title><description><![CDATA[Sharing to you words that kept on repeating during Lent and Holy Week.  The words were SANHEDRIN, PHARISEES, SADDUCEES … Just a bird’s eye…]]></description><link>http://bibanco.deleonanddeleon.com/looking-back/</link><guid isPermaLink="false">http://bibanco.deleonanddeleon.com/looking-back/</guid><pubDate>Wed, 27 May 2020 02:14:32 GMT</pubDate><content:encoded>&lt;p&gt;Sharing to you words that kept on repeating during Lent and Holy Week.  The words were &lt;strong&gt;SANHEDRIN, PHARISEES, SADDUCEES&lt;/strong&gt; …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Just a bird’s eye view …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sanhedrin&lt;/strong&gt; is the Supreme Court of the Jews which convened in Jerusalem.  Its origin is traced to the 2nd century BC,
and its primary role was to enforce Jewish law &amp;#x26; custom.  It is an assembly of either 23 members (or rabbis) or Lesser Sanhedrin/
Lesser Court for each city; and 71 members as Great Sanhedrin who act as Supreme Court which can also review appeals coming from decisions of the lesser courts.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The Great Sanhedrin&lt;/strong&gt; consisted of the reigning high priest who headed the court, the elders of Jerusalem’s leading families, chief priests who were previously high priests, scribes or lawyers who are experts in the Law of Moses.  Several members were also aligned with the &lt;strong&gt;Pharisees&lt;/strong&gt; or &lt;strong&gt;Sadducees&lt;/strong&gt;.  Under Roman rule, the Sanhedrin retained considerable freedom to regulate the civil and religious affairs of the Jewish life, except the right to administer capital punishment [see John 18:31].   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In the late 200 AD, the name Sanhedrin was dropped to avoid persecution and its decisions were issued under the name
Beit HaMidrash (house of learning).  Sanhedrin was later disbanded in 425 AD after continued persecution by the Roman Empire.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Pharisees&lt;/strong&gt; were members of ancient Jewish sect, distinguished by strict observance of the traditional and written law, and commonly held to have pretensions to superior sanctity. After the destruction the Jewish Temple at 70 AD, Pharisaic movement became the foundational, liturgical and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism.  Pharisees started 163 BC and dissolved 73 AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sadducees&lt;/strong&gt; were members of Jewish political &amp;#x26; religious movement who had conservative outlook and accepted only the written law
of Moses. They consisted of some priests and aristocratic members of the society; and supported Herod.  Sadducees started 167 BC
and dissolved 70 AD after the temple was destroyed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You might learn further the differences of beliefs of Pharisees &amp;#x26; Saduccees?  &lt;em&gt;[St Paul used this in his trial in Acts 23:6 and on]&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;FYI:  If you came across time lines of BCE and CE — BCE means Before the Common Era, is the same as our BC (Before Christ); and CE means Common Era, is the same as our AD (Anno Domini/After Death).  [You might research why these are so].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Genesis pictures the created world in a state of primeval chaos, submerged in water &amp;#x26; shrouded in darkness.  It is place unfit for life and habitation.  It conveys this idea as something “without form and void” &lt;em&gt;(Genesis 1:2)&lt;/em&gt;.  These formlessness and emptiness set the stage of creation in two phases: on days 1-2-3 God forms the world into its temporal &amp;#x26; spatial dimensions; and on days 4-5-6 He fills the world with its designated rulers.  Genesis thus arranges the creation account in symmetrical fashion, with the first three days corresponding to the second three days.  The seventh days stands apart as the day when God rested.  Inherent in this literary format is the message that the cosmos, in its artistic design and orderliness, bears witness to the consummate wisdom of the Creator &lt;em&gt;(see Psalm 19:1, Wisdom 13:5, Romans 1:20)&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FROM FORMLESSNESS:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 1  Day &amp;#x26; Night  &lt;em&gt;(Genesis 1:3-5;)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Day 2  Sea &amp;#x26; Sky    &lt;em&gt;(Geneses 1:6-8)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Day 3  Land &amp;#x26; Vegetation   &lt;em&gt;(Genesis 1:9-13)&lt;/em&gt;    &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;FROM EMPTINESS (VOID):&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Day 4  Sun, Moon, Stars   &lt;em&gt;(Genesis 1:14-19)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Day 5  Fish &amp;#x26; Birds   &lt;em&gt;(Genesis 1:20-23)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Day 6  Man &amp;#x26; Animals   &lt;em&gt;(Genesis 1:24-31)&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Day 7  The Sabbath Rest   (Genesis 2:1-3)&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The Sabbath which is set apart for the worship of God and the contemplation of His work, is a sign of His covenant with creation.  God sanctified the seventh day that work is ordered to worship, lest man become slave to his labor and fail to acknowledge his total dependence on the Lord (see &lt;strong&gt;Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) paragraphs 347, 2175-76&lt;/strong&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today the word doctor would probably those persons who are caring for physical or mental health.  The term “doctor” originally derived from the Latin word &lt;em&gt;“docere”&lt;/em&gt; meaning &lt;em&gt;“to teach”&lt;/em&gt;.  It designated anyone whose knowledge qualified to teach and not necessarily one who is skilled caring for human health.  Such “doctors” were experts in promoting another kind of health --- the health of the soul and spirit which comes from knowing the truth &lt;em&gt;[John 8:32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free;  John 14:6  I am the way, the truth, and the life]&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;“Doctors of the Church”&lt;/strong&gt; are people who have seen the glory of Jesus Christ, full of grace &amp;#x26; truth &lt;em&gt;[John 18:37-38  Jesus said “for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice”. Pilate said to him, what is truth?]&lt;/em&gt;.  In addition, by cooperating with God’s special graces and employing their unique intellectual &amp;#x26; pedagogical (education &amp;#x26; learning) gifts, they succeeded in an outstanding way in communicating the truth they have contemplated in Jesus.  As such, they are eminent teachers, their teachings bring health to the human heart and soul.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Who are these doctors?&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Athanasius&lt;/strong&gt; - Father of Orthodoxy, Defender of Christianity in the East, 297-373 AD (Feast day May 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Ephrem&lt;/strong&gt; - Father of Hymnody,  306-373 AD  (Feast day June 9)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Cyril of Jerusalem&lt;/strong&gt; - Doctor of Catechism, 315-386 AD  (Feast day March 18)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Hilary of Poitiers&lt;/strong&gt; - Defender of Christianity in the West,  315-368 AD  (Feast day January 13) &lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Gregory Nazianzen&lt;/strong&gt; - The Theologian,  329-386 AD  (Feast day January 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Basil the Great&lt;/strong&gt; - Father of Eastern Monasticism,  329-379 AD  (Feast day January 2)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Ambrose&lt;/strong&gt; - Patron of the Veneration of Mary,  340-397 AD  (Feast day December 7)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Jerome&lt;/strong&gt; - Father of Biblical Science,  342-420 AD  (Feast day September 30)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St John Chrysostom&lt;/strong&gt; - Doctor of the Eucharist,  347-407 AD  (Feast day September 13)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Augustine&lt;/strong&gt; - Doctor of Grace,  354-430 AD  (Feast day August 28)&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;&lt;strong&gt;St Cyril of Alexandra&lt;/strong&gt; - Doctor of the Incarnation,  376-444 AD  (Feast day June 27)&lt;/li&gt;

She is one of the Doctors of the Church, patroness of Italy, mystic, woman of action, heroine against overwhelming odds, persuaded Pope Gregory XI to leave &lt;em&gt;Avignon&lt;/em&gt; and return to Rome.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Catherine Benincasa is the youngest of the 25 children of a prosperous Sienese wool-dyer.  She rejected marriage and religious life but enamored of consecrated virginity.  At sixteen, she became a Dominican tertiary but continued to live at home.  For three years she left her room only for Mass and Confession.  Her mortification reached the point where she would manage on a spoonful of herbs and few hours of sleep a day.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At nineteen, after the experience of Christ placing a ring on her finger, visible only to herself, she resumed normal family life and began to care for the sick &amp;#x26; the poor.  Soon people were attracted by the charm of Catherine’s human &amp;#x26; supernatural qualities … her gaiety, religious fervor, social involvement, unconventionality, loyalty to the church, etc.  She wrote, “their concern was to remove hatred from people’s heart and bring them to peace with Christ crucified and their neighbors”.  At twenty-eight she received the stigmata, which also remained invisible to others until her death.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She had become all love for God and neighbor, ecstasies, peace missions, letters to help others and care for the ills of the church.  Infused wisdom and the gift of exhortation were her special charisms.  She took 23 of her group on the three month’s historic embassy to Avignon.  Reforms she saw would come not with war but with peace and quite, with the humble &amp;#x26; continuous prayers.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;She died in Rome at the age of thirty three sealing her activities with this offer of her life:
&lt;em&gt;“O eternal God, receive the sacrifice of my life for this mystical body of holy Church.  I have nothing to give but what you have given me.  Take my heart, therefore, and press it to the face of this spouse.”&lt;/em&gt;   &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;[&lt;strong&gt;Avignon&lt;/strong&gt; is a city in southeastern France where once the seat of the pope during 1309-1377. In some of those years, the Church had even two popes, one in Avignon and one in Rome.  St Catherine was instrumental of having Pope Gregory XI leave Avignon &amp;#x26; ended the confusion and returned the proper papal seat to Rome].&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you.&lt;/p&gt;

He was attributed as one of the gospel writers and some scholars said this was the first gospel written and was probably used as reference of the other synoptic gospels of Matthew and Luke.  The &lt;strong&gt;Gospel of Mark&lt;/strong&gt; was written between 65-70 AD.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Mark was the cousin of the St Barnabas &lt;em&gt;(Col 4:10)&lt;/em&gt; and he accompanied St Paul &amp;#x26; St Barnabas in their first missionary journey
&lt;em&gt;(Acts 12.25, Acts 13:5)&lt;/em&gt;, and sometimes he was known as John Mark (John was his Jewish name &amp;#x26; Mark was his Roman name).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;St Mark was later with St Peter whom he called “my son Mark” &lt;em&gt;(1 Peter 5:13)&lt;/em&gt;.  People called Mark as the interpreter of Peter (Papias AD 130, Iranaeus AD 180, Clement of Alexandria AD 200, Tertullian AD 200).  &lt;em&gt;We can then say that St Peter was the principal source of Mark’s gospel&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This gospel was geared towards the Gentile believers in imperial Rome.  To remind them their Lord Jesus endured sufferings and to encourage them to remain faithful during the times of trial (persecution of the Romans).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark paints a portrait of Jesus that is vivid &amp;#x26; dynamic, focusing most of his attention on Jesus’ mighty works, as active healer &amp;#x26; exorcist on the move  … even people were amazed with questions like “what is this? a new teachings?”; or “why does this man speak like this”? or “who can forgive sins but God alone”? “who is this, that even the wind &amp;#x26; sea obey him”?  These invite believers to look at Jesus with the eyes of faith, embrace him in hope, and imitate his love.  &lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;After the martyrdom of St Peter and St Paul in Rome, Mark went and founded the church in Alexandria, Egypt. Tradition said that he was dragged in the streets of Alexandria until he died.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Mark’s Gospel showed a symbol of a winged lion - a figure of courage and monarchy.  The lion also represents Jesus’ resurrection (as lions were believed to sleep with their eyes open, a comparison with Jesus in the tomb), and Christ as king.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;St Mark, pray for us!&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Thank you …&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item><item><title><![CDATA[Reconnect]]></title><description><![CDATA[Kapatid, We will share some quotes amidst this time of difficulties & concerns. One of

&lt;p&gt;We will share some quotes amidst this time of difficulties &amp;#x26; concerns. One of
the areas of hope is the Words of our Redeemer that we can always cling on.&lt;br&gt;
Please continue to pray …&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Quote:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;‘PEACE  …  it’s just a prayer away.’&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;h3&gt;Passage:&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer &amp;#x26; petition,
with thanksgiving, present your request to God.  And the &gt; peace of God,
which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your minds
in Christ Jesus.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Philippians 4:6-7&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Peace be with you and your loved ones …&lt;/p&gt;

This is appropriate in this time of uncertainty, yet we know
that God will protect us.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“You who dwell in the shadow of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
Say to the Lord, my refuge &amp;#x26; fortress, my God in whom I trust.  God will rescue you from the
fowler’s snare, from the destroying plague, will shelter you with pinions, spread wings that
you may take refuge; God’s faithfulness is a protecting shield.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall not fear the terror of the night nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence
that roams in darkness, nor the plague that ravages at noon.  Though a thousand fall at your
side, ten thousand at your right hand, near you it shall not come.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You need simply watch; the punishment of the wicked you shall see.  You have the Lord for
your refuge; you have made the Most High your stronghold.  No evil shall befall you,
no affliction come near your tent.  For God commands the angels to guard you in your ways.
With their hands they shall support you, lest you strike your foot against a strong.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;You shall tread upon the asp and the vipers, trample the lion and the dragon.  Whoever clings
to me I will deliver; whoever knows my name I will set on high.  All who call upon me I will
answer; I will be with them in distress; I will deliver them and give them honor.
Will length of days I will satisfy them and show them my saving power.”&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
&lt;p&gt;See if you can also sing &lt;strong&gt;“On Eagles Wings”&lt;/strong&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world with out end”.  Amen.&lt;/p&gt;</content:encoded></item></channel></rss>
