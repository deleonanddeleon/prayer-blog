Today is the feast-day of the evangelist **St Mark**.  He was attributed as one of the gospel writers and some scholars said this was the first gospel written and was probably used as reference of the other synoptic gospels of Matthew and Luke.  The **Gospel of Mark** was written between 65-70 AD.

St Mark was the cousin of the St Barnabas *(Col 4:10)* and he accompanied St Paul & St Barnabas in their first missionary journey
*(Acts 12.25, Acts 13:5)*, and sometimes he was known as John Mark (John was his Jewish name & Mark was his Roman name).

St Mark was later with St Peter whom he called "my son Mark" *(1 Peter 5:13)*.  People called Mark as the interpreter of Peter (Papias AD 130, Iranaeus AD 180, Clement of Alexandria AD 200, Tertullian AD 200).  *We can then say that St Peter was the principal source of Mark's gospel*.

This gospel was geared towards the Gentile believers in imperial Rome.  To remind them their Lord Jesus endured sufferings and to encourage them to remain faithful during the times of trial (persecution of the Romans).

Mark paints a portrait of Jesus that is vivid & dynamic, focusing most of his attention on Jesus' mighty works, as active healer & exorcist on the move  .... even people were amazed with questions like "what is this? a new teachings?"; or "why does this man speak like this"? or "who can forgive sins but God alone"? "who is this, that even the wind & sea obey him"?  These invite believers to look at Jesus with the eyes of faith, embrace him in hope, and imitate his love.  

After the martyrdom of St Peter and St Paul in Rome, Mark went and founded the church in Alexandria, Egypt. Tradition said that he was dragged in the streets of Alexandria until he died.

Mark's Gospel showed a symbol of a winged lion - a figure of courage and monarchy.  The lion also represents Jesus' resurrection (as lions were believed to sleep with their eyes open, a comparison with Jesus in the tomb), and Christ as king.

*St Mark, pray for us!*

Thank you .....
