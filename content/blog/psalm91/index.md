Sharing to you Psalm 91 *(Security under God's Protection)*.
This is appropriate in this time of uncertainty, yet we know 
that God will protect us.

> "You who dwell in the shadow of the Most High, who abide in the shadow of the Almighty.
> Say to the Lord, my refuge & fortress, my God in whom I trust.  God will rescue you from the
> fowler's snare, from the destroying plague, will shelter you with pinions, spread wings that 
> you may take refuge; God's faithfulness is a protecting shield.
>
> You shall not fear the terror of the night nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence
> that roams in darkness, nor the plague that ravages at noon.  Though a thousand fall at your
> side, ten thousand at your right hand, near you it shall not come.
>
> You need simply watch; the punishment of the wicked you shall see.  You have the Lord for
> your refuge; you have made the Most High your stronghold.  No evil shall befall you, 
> no affliction come near your tent.  For God commands the angels to guard you in your ways.
> With their hands they shall support you, lest you strike your foot against a strong.
>
> You shall tread upon the asp and the vipers, trample the lion and the dragon.  Whoever clings
> to me I will deliver; whoever knows my name I will set on high.  All who call upon me I will
> answer; I will be with them in distress; I will deliver them and give them honor.
> Will length of days I will satisfy them and show them my saving power."

See if you can also sing **"On Eagles Wings"**.

"Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the 
beginning, is now, and ever shall be, world with out end".  Amen.
