The term “doctor” originally derived from the Latin word <em>“docere”</em> meaning <em>“to teach”</em>.  It designated anyone whose knowledge qualified to teach and not necessarily one who is skilled caring for human health.  Such “doctors” were experts in promoting another kind of health --- the health of the soul and spirit which comes from knowing the truth <em>[John 8:32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free;  John 14:6  I am the way, the truth, and the life]</em>. </p>\n<p>The <strong>“Doctors of the Church”</strong> are people who have seen the glory of Jesus Christ, full of grace &#x26; truth <em>[John 18:37-38  Jesus said “for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice”. Pilate said to him, what is truth?]</em>.  In addition, by cooperating with God’s special graces and employing their unique intellectual &#x26; pedagogical (education &#x26; learning) gifts, they succeeded in an outstanding way in communicating the truth they have contemplated in Jesus.  As such, they are eminent teachers, their teachings bring health to the human heart and soul.</p>\n<p>Who are these doctors?</p>\n<ul>\n<li><strong>St Athanasius</strong> - Father of Orthodoxy, Defender of Christianity in the East, 297-373 AD (Feast day May 2)</li>\n<li><strong>St Ephrem</strong> - Father of Hymnody,  306-373 AD  (Feast day June 9)</li>\n<li><strong>St Cyril of Jerusalem</strong> - Doctor of Catechism, 315-386 AD  (Feast day March 18)</li>\n<li><strong>St Hilary of Poitiers</strong> - Defender of Christianity in the West,  315-368 AD  (Feast day January 13) </li>\n<li><strong>St Gregory Nazianzen</strong> - The Theologian,  329-386 AD  (Feast day January 2)</li>\n<li><strong>St Basil the Great</strong> - Father of Eastern Monasticism,  329-379 AD  (Feast day January 2)</li>\n<li><strong>St Ambrose</strong> - Patron of the Veneration of Mary,  340-397 AD  (Feast day December 7)</li>\n<li><strong>St Jerome</strong> - Father of Biblical Science,  342-420 AD  (Feast day September 30)</li>\n<li><strong>St John Chrysostom</strong> - Doctor of the Eucharist,  347-407 AD  (Feast day September 13)</li>\n<li><strong>St Augustine</strong> - Doctor of Grace,  354-430 AD  (Feast day August 28)</li>\n<li><strong>St Cyril of Alexandra</strong> - Doctor of the Incarnation,  376-444 AD  (Feast day June 27)</li>\n<li><strong>Pope St Leo the Great</strong> - Doctor of the Unity of the Church,  400-450 AD (Feast day November 10)</li>\n<li><strong>St Peter Chrysologus</strong> - The Golden-Worded  406-450 AD  (Feast day July 30)</li>\n<li><strong>Pope St Gregory the Great</strong> - The Greatest of the Great,  540-604 AD  (Feast day September 3)</li>\n<li><strong>St Isidore of Seville</strong> - Schoolmaster of the Middle Ages,  560-636 AD  (Feast day April 4)</li>\n<li><strong>St Bede the Venerable</strong> - Father of English History,  673-735 AD  (Feast day May 25)</li>\n<li><strong>St John Damascene</strong> - Doctor of Assumption and Christian Art,  676-749 AD  (Feast day December 4)</li>\n<li><strong>St Peter Damian</strong> - Monitor of the Popes,  1007-1072 AD  (Feast day February 21)</li>\n<li><strong>St Anselm</strong> - Father of Scholasticism,  1033-1109 AD  (Feast day April 21)</li>\n<li><strong>St Bernard of Clairvauz</strong> - The Mellifluous Doctor, 1090-1153 AD  (Feast day August 20)</li>\n<li><strong>St Anthony the Padua</strong> - Doctor of the Gospel,  1195-1231 AD  (Feast day June 13)</li>\n<li><strong>St Albert the Great</strong> - The Universal Doctor,  1206-1231 AD  (Feast day November 15) </li>\n<li><strong>St Bonaventure</strong> - The Seraphic Doctor,  1221-1274 AD  (Feast day July 15)</li>\n<li><strong>St Thomas Aquinas</strong> - The Angelic Doctor,  1225-1274 AD  (Feast day January 28)</li>\n<li><strong>St Catherine of Siena</strong> - Mystic of Incarnate Word,  1347-1380 AD  (Feast day April 29)</li>\n<li><strong>St Theresa of Avila</strong> - Doctor of Prayer,  1515-1582 AD  (Feast day October 15)</li>\n<li><strong>St Peter Canisius</strong> - Doctor of Catechism,  1521-1597 AD  (Feast day April 27)</li>\n<li><strong>St Robert Bellarmine</strong> - Prince of Apologists,  1542-1621 AD  (Feast day September 17)</li>\n<li><strong>St John of the Cross</strong> - Doctor of Mystical Theology,  1542-1591 AD  (Feast day  December 14)</li>\n<li><strong>St Lawrence of Brindisi</strong> - The Apostolic Doctor,  1559-1619 AD  (Feast day July 21)</li>\n<li><strong>St Francis de Sales</strong> - The Gentleman Doctor,  1567-1622 AD  (Feast day January 24)</li>\n<li><strong>St Alphonsus Liguori</strong> - Prince of Moralists,  1696-1787 AD  Feast day August 1)</li>\n<li><strong>St Therese of Lisieux</strong> - Doctor of of the Little Way, Doctor of Merciful Love,  1873-1897 AD  (Feast day Oct 1)</li>\n</ul>","frontmatter":{"title":"Doctors of the Church","date":"May 23, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/doctors-church/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/priestly-ministry/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Priestly Ministry and the Essentials of Christian Discipleship in the Time of Coronavirus"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/conformity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Conformity"}}}}}
