God will rescue you from the\nfowler’s snare, from the destroying plague, will shelter you with pinions, spread wings that\nyou may take refuge; God’s faithfulness is a protecting shield.</p>\n<p>You shall not fear the terror of the night nor the arrow that flies by day, nor the pestilence\nthat roams in darkness, nor the plague that ravages at noon.  Though a thousand fall at your\nside, ten thousand at your right hand, near you it shall not come.</p>\n<p>You need simply watch; the punishment of the wicked you shall see.  You have the Lord for\nyour refuge; you have made the Most High your stronghold.  No evil shall befall you,\nno affliction come near your tent.  For God commands the angels to guard you in your ways.\nWith their hands they shall support you, lest you strike your foot against a strong.</p>\n<p>You shall tread upon the asp and the vipers, trample the lion and the dragon.  Whoever clings\nto me I will deliver; whoever knows my name I will set on high.  All who call upon me I will\nanswer; I will be with them in distress; I will deliver them and give them honor.\nWill length of days I will satisfy them and show them my saving power.”</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>See if you can also sing <strong>“On Eagles Wings”</strong>.</p>\n<p>“Glory be to the Father, and to the Son, and to the Holy Spirit; as it was in the\nbeginning, is now, and ever shall be, world with out end”.
