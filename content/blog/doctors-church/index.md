As of now there are 33 Doctors of the Church.

Today the word doctor would probably those persons who are caring for physical or mental health.  The term "doctor" originally derived from the Latin word *"docere"* meaning *"to teach"*.  It designated anyone whose knowledge qualified to teach and not necessarily one who is skilled caring for human health.  Such "doctors" were experts in promoting another kind of health --- the health of the soul and spirit which comes from knowing the truth *[John 8:32 And you shall know the truth, and the truth shall make you free;  John 14:6  I am the way, the truth, and the life]*. 

The **"Doctors of the Church"** are people who have seen the glory of Jesus Christ, full of grace & truth *[John 18:37-38  Jesus said "for this I have come into the world, to bear witness to the truth. Every one who is of the truth hears my voice". Pilate said to him, what is truth?]*.  In addition, by cooperating with God's special graces and employing their unique intellectual & pedagogical (education & learning) gifts, they succeeded in an outstanding way in communicating the truth they have contemplated in Jesus.  As such, they are eminent teachers, their teachings bring health to the human heart and soul.
