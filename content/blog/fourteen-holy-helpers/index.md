I received a novena for covid-19 and mentioned the intercession of the **Fourteen Holy Helpers**. 
Who and what are they?
 
They are group of saints venerated by Catholics because of their intercession is believed to be 
effective against various diseases.  They are called *"Nothelfer"* in German *("helper in need")*, originated
in the 14th century during the **Black Death** in 1346-1349 (bubonic plague) where millions died.  Basilica of the Fourteen Holy Helpers is found in Bamberg Germany.
 
### The 14 Saints are:
 
- **St. Acacius (Agathius)** - against headaches.
- **St. Barbara** - prayed for fever; against sudden & violent death.
- **St. Blaise** - prayed for the ills of the throat; protection of domestic animals.
- **St. Christopher** - invoked against plagues; against danger while travelling.
- **St. Cyriacus** - invoked against temptations on the deathbed; demonic possession; against eye diseases.
