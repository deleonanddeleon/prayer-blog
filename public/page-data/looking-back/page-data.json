The words were <strong>SANHEDRIN, PHARISEES, SADDUCEES</strong> …</p>\n<p>Just a bird’s eye view …</p>\n<p><strong>Sanhedrin</strong> is the Supreme Court of the Jews which convened in Jerusalem.  Its origin is traced to the 2nd century BC,\nand its primary role was to enforce Jewish law &#x26; custom.  It is an assembly of either 23 members (or rabbis) or Lesser Sanhedrin/\nLesser Court for each city; and 71 members as Great Sanhedrin who act as Supreme Court which can also review appeals coming from decisions of the lesser courts.</p>\n<p><strong>The Great Sanhedrin</strong> consisted of the reigning high priest who headed the court, the elders of Jerusalem’s leading families, chief priests who were previously high priests, scribes or lawyers who are experts in the Law of Moses.  Several members were also aligned with the <strong>Pharisees</strong> or <strong>Sadducees</strong>.  Under Roman rule, the Sanhedrin retained considerable freedom to regulate the civil and religious affairs of the Jewish life, except the right to administer capital punishment [see John 18:31].   </p>\n<p>In the late 200 AD, the name Sanhedrin was dropped to avoid persecution and its decisions were issued under the name\nBeit HaMidrash (house of learning).  Sanhedrin was later disbanded in 425 AD after continued persecution by the Roman Empire.</p>\n<p><strong>Pharisees</strong> were members of ancient Jewish sect, distinguished by strict observance of the traditional and written law, and commonly held to have pretensions to superior sanctity. After the destruction the Jewish Temple at 70 AD, Pharisaic movement became the foundational, liturgical and ritualistic basis for Rabbinic Judaism.  Pharisees started 163 BC and dissolved 73 AD.</p>\n<p><strong>Sadducees</strong> were members of Jewish political &#x26; religious movement who had conservative outlook and accepted only the written law\nof Moses. They consisted of some priests and aristocratic members of the society; and supported Herod.  Sadducees started 167 BC\nand dissolved 70 AD after the temple was destroyed.</p>\n<p>You might learn further the differences of beliefs of Pharisees &#x26; Saduccees?  <em>[St Paul used this in his trial in Acts 23:6 and on]</em></p>\n<p><em>FYI:  If you came across time lines of BCE and CE — BCE means Before the Common Era, is the same as our BC (Before Christ); and CE means Common Era, is the same as our AD (Anno Domini/After Death).  [You might research why these are so].</em></p>\n<p>Thank you.</p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Looking Back","date":"May 27, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/looking-back/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/conformity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Conformity"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/fourteen-holy-helpers/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Fourteen Holy Helpers"}}}}}
