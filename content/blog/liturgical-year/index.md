The **Liturgical Year** consists of the cycle of Liturgical Seasons in Christian Churches that determines when feast days, including celebrations of saints, are to be observed and which portion of Scripture are to be read either in an annual cycle or in cycle of several years.
 
The Liturgical Cycle divides the year into a series of seasons, each with their own mood, theological emphases, and modes of prayer, which can be signified by different ways of decorating churches, colors of paraments and vestments for clergy, scripture readings, themes of preaching and even different traditions and practices often observed personally or in home.  Following the decision of the Second Vatican Council, the Catholic Church revised the lectionary in 1969, adopting a three-year cycle of readings for Sundays (cycles A,B,C) and a two-year cycle for weekdays.
 
The Western Christian liturgical calendars are based on the cycle of the Roman Rite of the Catholic Church beginning with:
 
- ***ADVENT*** is the time of preparation for both the celebration of Jesus' birth, and His expected second coming at the end of time. This season lasts until Christmas eve on Dec 24. 
- ***CHRISTMAS*** follows with first vespers on the evening of Dec 24 and ending with Feast of the Baptism of the Lord. 
- ***ORDINARY TIME*** comes next.  
- ***LENT*** follows which is the period of purification and penance that begins on Ash Wednesday and ends on Holy Thursday.  
- Then comes the ***Easter Triduum*** from Mass of the Lord's Last Supper in Holy Thursday including Good Friday, Holy Saturday and Easter Sunday. The days of the Easter Triduum recall Jesus' last supper with His disciples, His death on the cross, burial, and resurrection. 
- ***EASTER*** then follows with seven-week liturgical season climaxing at Pentecost. This feast recalls the descent of the Holy Spirit upon the apostles/disciples after Jesus' Ascension.  
- ***ORDINARY TIME***  comes next again, but with more days, and completes the liturgical year. 
 
 
### Colors of Priests' vestments:
- ***Green***  =  used during Ordinary Time
- ***Purple/Violet***  =   used during Advent and Lent
- ***White and Gold***  =  most appropriate during Christmas and Easter
- ***Rose***  =  on the third Sunday of Advent and fourth Sunday of Lent (this color is a sign of anticipated joy). 
- ***Red***  =  for feast day of the Passion and for the Holy Spirit; feast day of martyred saints.
- ***White and Black***  =  used during funeral masses.
