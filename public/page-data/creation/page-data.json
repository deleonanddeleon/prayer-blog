It is place unfit for life and habitation.  It conveys this idea as something “without form and void” <em>(Genesis 1:2)</em>.  These formlessness and emptiness set the stage of creation in two phases: on days 1-2-3 God forms the world into its temporal &#x26; spatial dimensions; and on days 4-5-6 He fills the world with its designated rulers.  Genesis thus arranges the creation account in symmetrical fashion, with the first three days corresponding to the second three days.  The seventh days stands apart as the day when God rested.  Inherent in this literary format is the message that the cosmos, in its artistic design and orderliness, bears witness to the consummate wisdom of the Creator <em>(see Psalm 19:1, Wisdom 13:5, Romans 1:20)</em>.</p>\n<h3>FROM FORMLESSNESS:</h3>\n<p>Day 1  Day &#x26; Night  <em>(Genesis 1:3-5;)</em><br>\nDay 2  Sea &#x26; Sky    <em>(Geneses 1:6-8)</em><br>\nDay 3  Land &#x26; Vegetation   <em>(Genesis 1:9-13)</em>    </p>\n<h3>FROM EMPTINESS (VOID):</h3>\n<p>Day 4  Sun, Moon, Stars   <em>(Genesis 1:14-19)</em><br>\nDay 5  Fish &#x26; Birds   <em>(Genesis 1:20-23)</em><br>\nDay 6  Man &#x26; Animals   <em>(Genesis 1:24-31)</em></p>\n<h3>Day 7  The Sabbath Rest   (Genesis 2:1-3)</h3>\n<p>The Sabbath which is set apart for the worship of God and the contemplation of His work, is a sign of His covenant with creation.  God sanctified the seventh day that work is ordered to worship, lest man become slave to his labor and fail to acknowledge his total dependence on the Lord (see <strong>Catechism of the Catholic Church (CCC) paragraphs 347, 2175-76</strong>).</p>\n<p><em>[Please read the passages in your Bibles/Catechism as indicated]</em>.</p>\n<p>Thank you and you can share this email.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>References:<br>\nCatholic Bible Revised Standard Version<br>\nIgnatius Catholic Study Bible<br>\nCatechism of the Catholic Church (CCC)  </p>","frontmatter":{"title":"Creation","date":"May 25, 2020","description":null}}},"pageContext":{"slug":"/creation/","previous":{"fields":{"slug":"/doctors-church/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Doctors of the Church"}},"next":{"fields":{"slug":"/conformity/"},"frontmatter":{"title":"Conformity"}}}}}
