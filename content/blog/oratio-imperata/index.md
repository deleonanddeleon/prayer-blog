Kapatid,

In case you haven't got these prayers on Covid 19 pandemic, sharing to you the 
**Oratio Imperata** and **US Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCB) Prayer of Solidarity**.
You can include these as you pray the Flores de Mayo Rosary honoring our Blessed Mother.


Thank you and keep safe.

### Oratio Imperata 
#### on the threat from COVID-19
God our Father,  
We come to you in our need  
To ask your protection against the COVID-19 Virus,  
That has claimed lives  
And has affected many.

We pray for your grace  
For the people tasked with studying the nature and cause  
Of this virus and its disease  
And of stemming the tide of its transmission.  
Guide the hands and minds of medical experts  
That they may minister to the sick  
With competence and compassion,  
And of those governments and private agencies  
That must find cure and solution to this epidemic.

We pray for those afflicted  
May they be restored to health soon.

Grant us the grace  
To work for the good of all  
And to help those in need.

Grant this through our Lord, Jesus Christ, your Son,  
Who lives and reigns with You, in the unity of the Holy Spirit,  
God, forever and ever. Amen.

*Mary Help of all Christians, pray for us.*  
*St. Raphael the Archangel, pray for us.*  
*St. Rock, pray for us.*  
*St. Lorenzo Ruiz, pray for us.*  
*St. Pedro Calungsod, pray for us.*

### COVID-19: A Prayer of Solidarity

For all who have contracted coronavirus,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray for care and healing.

For those who are particularly vulnerable,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray for safety and protection.

For all who experience fear or anxiety,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray for peace of mind and spirit.

For affected families who are facing difficult decisions between food on the table or public safety,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray for policies that recognize their plight.

For those who do not have adequate health insurance,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray that no family will face financial burdens alone.

For those who are afraid to access care due to immigration status,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray for recognition of the God-given dignity of all.

For our brothers and sisters around the world,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray for shared solidarity.

For public officials and decisionmakers,  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We pray for wisdom and guidance.

Father, during this time may your Church be a sign of hope, comfort and love to all.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant peace.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant comfort.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Grant healing.  
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be with us, Lord.  

Amen.
